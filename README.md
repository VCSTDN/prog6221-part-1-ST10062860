# How to Compile and Run the Recipe Application
1. Install Visual Studio if you don't already have it installed. You can download it from the Microsoft website: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/
2. Download or clone the source code for the recipe application.
3. Open the recipe application solution file (RecipeApplication.sln) in Visual Studio.
4. Build the solution by clicking on the "Build" menu and selecting "Build Solution" or by pressing Ctrl+Shift+B.
5. If the build is successful, you should see a message at the bottom of the screen indicating that the build succeeded. If there are any errors, you'll need to resolve them before you can run the application.
6. To run the application, click on the "Debug" menu and select "Start Without Debugging" or press Ctrl+F5.
7. The application will start in the command prompt. Follow the on-screen prompts to enter recipe details, scale the recipe, reset the quantities, or clear the data and enter a new recipe.

That's it! You should now be able to compile and run the recipe application. If you have any issues or questions, please feel free to reach out.
